Weaviate has always been and will continue to be an open source vector search engine. To highlight this, we want to give Weaviate users and community members the best developer experience possible by offering plenty of tutorials and examples.

Are you good at making applications? Do you enjoy building and testing new technology and have a strong interest in open source? You can help Weaviate by creating demo applications and tutorials. We will store them in our [Weaviate Examples](https://github.com/semi-technologies/weaviate-examples) repository and help your concept reach out to other developers!

Go ahead and submit a pull request in [Weaviate Examples](https://github.com/semi-technologies/weaviate-examples) repository today!

#### Contribute to the community by developing a demo app using Weaviate.

Similar to [writing technical blogs](Writing-blogs.md), you can even create awesome apps you built using Weaviate! 

You could also contribute by creating a demo application that uses Weaviate under the hood. It can be anything! A Web app, mobile app or demos showing certain [integrations](https://weaviate.io/product.html).

A few things to note:

* Your app must be unique from the previous examples
* Your app should include a README.md file that describes how to use it
* Don't forget to mention the [module(s)](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/current/modules/index.html) you used to create the app

Ready to create awesome demos? Let's go! We welcome as many demo apps as you can create. One thing to keep in mind: **quality over quantity**.

After you are done with creating your demo application, create a pull request in [Weaviate Examples](https://github.com/semi-technologies/weaviate-examples) repsository by filling out the template.
